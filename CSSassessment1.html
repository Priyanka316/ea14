      When comparing CSS class vs ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a special elements or range of
      elements on web page. Once an elements has been targeted,a style or set of
      styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors avaialble. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
